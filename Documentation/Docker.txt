why use Docker

consistent dev and prod environment
if we use docker we dont need to same things in production or dev
The all of our dependency project inside the docker image
the other dev just install docker and run the image which

first we will create Dockerfile which contains all the operating system dependency
that our projects needs

create Docker Compose configuration which tells
Docker how to run the images that are created from our Dockerfile
configuration

we will run all commands via Docker Compose


Dockerhub image

we can get various image like python postgres etc from docker hub

Authenticate with docker hub
create account setup credential
login before running job
get 200 pulls/6hr for free
